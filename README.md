# cross-space-mapping
The code for my undergraduate dissertation on cross-space mapping for named entity linking.

This uses the [COMETA](https://github.com/cambridgeltl/cometa) dataset ([Basaldella et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03295.pdf)) of terms linked to entities in the SNOMED-CT knowledge database.
